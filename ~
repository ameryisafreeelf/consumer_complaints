    Output: Void, the side-effect is that a line is parsed and added to records (a list of lists)
    
    This parses a line of the CSV without calling any functions outside of standard Python. The edge case we need to check for 
    is values in quotation marks. If one of our values is "Mark, the data engineer, says hi", this has to be parsed as one value 
    and we clearly cannot split at commas within the quotations. We handle this by essentially using ad-hoc parsing to look for 
    quotation mark. 
    
    Testing- check that all lists within records are the same length. Since the first length denotes column headers, ensure that
    they are all the same length as the first list in records.
